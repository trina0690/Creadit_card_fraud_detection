# Credit Card Fraud Detection Model

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** project! This initiative is designed to build an advanced machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data. By leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and sophisticated data processing techniques, this project aims to improve financial security and reduce the incidence of fraud.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Accurate Fraud Detection**: Develop a model to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
- **Handle Data Imbalance**: Implement strategies to address the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using various metrics to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.

## 🛠️ Tools and Techniques

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: 
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forests

- **Data Processing**: 
  - Scaling (Standardization)
  - Encoding Categorical Features
  - Handling Imbalanced Data with Techniques such as SMOTE

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC

## 📈 Model Performance

The model has been thoroughly evaluated and shows outstanding performance:

- **Accuracy**: 99.66%
- **Precision (Fraudulent Transactions)**: 0.99
- **Recall (Fraudulent Transactions)**: 1.00
- **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.9966

These metrics demonstrate that the model excels at both identifying fraudulent transactions and minimizing false positives.
